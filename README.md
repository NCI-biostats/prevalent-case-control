The tutorial on Rpubs provides examples on how to obtain parameter estimates and their standard errors using data from case-control studies with incident and prevalent cases. The detailed methods are discussed in ``**Inference for case-control studies with incident and prevalent cases**'' by __Marlena Maziarz__*, __Yukun Liu__*, __Jing Qin__ and __Ruth Pfeiffer__. The manuscript and the supplement can be found on [http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06365].  (* equal contributions)
