The tutorial on Rpubs provides examples on how to obtain parameter estimates and their standard errors using data from case-control studies with incident and prevalent cases. The detailed methods are discussed in ``Inference for case-control studies with incident and prevalent cases'' by Marlena Maziarz*, Yukun Liu*, Jing Qin and Ruth Pfeiffer. The manuscript and the supplement can be found on [http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06365].
